# Discode (rewrite)

My not so popular Discode bot. Rewritten in Kotlin.

## Why?

The original Discode bot is written in C. As much as I like the Concord library. I would have an easier time using Kotlin with the JDA library. Plus, I want to learn Java/Kotlin anyways.

## How to run

### Dependencies

- OpenJDK
- Kotlin
- Gradle

### Set up project

1. Clone and move into the repo (`git clone https://github.com/discode-devs/rewrite && rewrite`)
2. Create a .env file in the root of the project with the text: `DEVTOKEN=YOUR-BOT-TOKEN` and `GUILD=YOUR-GUILD-ID`
